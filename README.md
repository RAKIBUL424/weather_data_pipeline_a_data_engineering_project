# Fully Automated Data Pipeline Project (Data Engineering)
Welcome to the **Fully Automated Data Pipeline Project** repository
This project is demonstrate a complete ETL pipeline which is fully automated. This project is done on Docker images of AirFlow, dbt, PostgresSQL and Apache Superset. This projects is done completly end-to-end data ingestation from realtime API to data visualization and analysis in a automated fashion.

## 📖 Project Overview

This project involves:

1. **Data Source**: We use API from https://weatherstack.com/.
2. **ETL Pipelines**: Python is used for data ingestation and stored in Postgres data base.
3. **Data Processing**: All the processing is handles by Dbt Core.
4. **Visualize and Analysis**: this task is done by Apache Superset.
5. **Orchestration**: To make all the function realtime, orchestration is managed by AirFlow.
6. **Containerization**: All the componontes of the pipeline is not physically installed in the device. We use docker images of all the components.


🎯 This repository is an excellent resource for professionals and students looking to showcase expertise in:


- Data Engineering  
- ETL Pipeline Developer
